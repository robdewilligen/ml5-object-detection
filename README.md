# ml5-object-detection
Welcome to my repo of ml5 object detection

In this version i will create multiple iterrations of the object
detection from ml5.

## Iterration 1
- This version contains the basics found on the website of ml5.  
- The used model CocoSSD is able to recognise objects in a given picture.  
- After recognising the objects it will draw a square around the object 
and give it a label.
